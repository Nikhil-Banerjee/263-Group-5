# 263-Group-5
CM Project for ENGSCI 263 by Group 5, Semester 2, 2021.

This repositry constitues all the resources used, as well as the code, documents, and plots produced by Group 5, in their CM project regarding the Thermal Recovery of Bitumen on the West Coast of NZ. 

Files created include:

README.md - A brief overview of the repositry. 

main.py - The main implementation, that includes functions (Lumped Parameter Models and Improved Euler Implementation) used in the model's implementation, model calibration, the model's use for scenario exploration and future prediction, and generation of uncertainty in the model. 

benchmark.py - Solving of the model, comparing a numerical solution to an analytical solution, as well as a convergence test to determine the appropriate step size to use in the Improved Euler Implementation in the model. 

Unit_Tests.py - Quality control and code verfication, that is Unit Tests, of the functions implemented in creation of the model. 

Plots produced - a folder containing all of the plots produced in creation of the model, and to reflect the model's results. 

Other files present include information about the project, given data, peer review information, initial proposal content and other useful resources in relation to the project.
